Hello i am ishaq shaik.

I got this assignment from Factwise Tech Company.
==================================================


Deployment Link : https://factwisetech-ishaq-shaik-assignment.netlify.app/

1. In this Asiignment i build the user interface page showing Celebraties details like name,age,gender,profile picture and Description


2. The page has a search bar to search the list by celebrity name.

3. The user list item is an accordion,

   - when clicked on, it will cause all the other accordions to collapse and enlarge the one which was clicked.
   - If clicked on the same one it will collapse.
   - Manage the + and - icons in open or collapsed mode (collapsed = - | open = +)



4. - I have calculated the age of the user based on the date of birth provided
   - gender is a dropdown (Male | Female | Transgender | Rather not say | Other)
   - country is a text field
   - Description is a text area

5. Provide buttons to edit or delete

   - edit mode will let you edit the details of the user in the exact place
   - you can only edit the user if the user is an adult
   - validations to be implemented where a user cannot
     -- input text in the age field
     -- input numbers in the nationality
     -- keep anything empty
   - when in edit mode you can either save or cancel
     -- save button will be disabled by default and will enable only if the details have changed
     -- save click will update the user's details
     -- cancel will revert the details to their last known state
     -- you cannot open another accordion while in edit mode
   - delete mode should alert you if you actually want to delete the user
     -- if yes - the user will be deleted
     -- if no - do nothing

============================

I believe i achieved  all the requirements given by the company.
